## Synthetic non-overlapping light curves, 1

This experiment is coded in this [folder](ConvolvedGaussianProcessesExperiments/Synthetics/Experiment3/).

The purpose of this numerical experiment is to see whether it is theoretically possible to recover the mass parameter for a set of lightcurves that do not overlap in time.

This is a figure of the synthetically generated light curves:

This is the inferred posterior mass:
